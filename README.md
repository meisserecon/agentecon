This is the master branch of the agent-based model created by Luzius Meisser.

There are branches for different configurations of the base simulation.

Releases that correspond to formal papers come with their own DOI. So far, there is one, namely:

###General instructions

In order to modify and run the model yourself, you should follow these steps:

1. Make sure a git client is installed. I am using SourceTree: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
2. Make sure an IDE for Java is installed. I am using eclipse for Java EE developers, obtainable from https://eclipse.org/downloads/ .
3. Add this repository (https://github.com/kronrod/agentecon.git) in your git and checkout the tag or branch from the title.
4. Import the project to eclipse. In case you are using a different IDE, make sure to add jar\agenteconinterface.jar and jar\jacop-4.3.0.jar library to the classpath.
5. Run the class mentioned above.
