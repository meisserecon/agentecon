> A Vue.js project

Attention: App is supposed to run in subdirectory 'vis' of Domain. Therefore, the starting URL of the app in development is localhost:8080/vis and the dist directory output from the build step has to be uploaded to the /vis directory on the server.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
